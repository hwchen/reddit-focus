Idea is to not have to see new comments. Reddit is designed around engagement, so I'm always checking the comments sections. However, I can get useful info from just the links. And jumping into the comments isn't so bad, it's more that I can't go back to check constantly if there's new comments to read.

Seeing things in cli is also nice; get right to the info, so I don't have to scroll around to see if I missed something. High information density.
